# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve BLUX10K. This repo is intentionally small and documentation-driven, so
changes should stay focused and easy to review.

## What to work on

- Documentation accuracy and clarity.
- Safe updates to configuration templates.
- Improvements to the standalone font installer (`fonts/install-fonts.sh`).

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Keep changes minimal and scoped.
3. Update docs when behavior changes.
4. Open a pull request describing what changed and why.

## Notes

- Avoid adding new dependencies.
- Do not modify binary assets (fonts).
- Keep user data safe: never commit real secrets or personal dotfiles.
